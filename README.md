# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**

For this analysis we look at and compare the data for each city type, rural, suburban, and urban and the differences between fares and total rides.

**Results:**

Here is an overall look at the total amount of rides, drivers, and average fares per each city type. Urban has the highest amount of rides, drivers, and overall profit, but they are the lowest in average fares per ride and drivers. Rural is the inverse with the lowest number of rides and drivers but fares per ride and driver are at their highest. The Suburbs remain in the middle, if a bit closer to Urban numbers.

Here is a sample of weekly fares per city type over a few months, from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019. 

Below is a chart of the same data:

For reasons unknown, there is a sharp decline at the beginning of April

**Summary:** 

From this data we can infer that urban centers should be focused on, as profits are highest there and fares are more affordable than in Rural and Suburban centers. 

There shouldn't be as many drivers hired for Rural and Suburban centers as the demand just isn't as high. 

A multi year analysis should be peformed to see if the peaks and declines in the graph are consistent, or if it was due to one off events.
